/** Semaphores – Restrict the number of threads that can access a resource. Example, limit max 10 connections to access a file simultaneously.
 * Mutex – Only one thread to access a resource at once. Example, when a client is accessing a file, no one else should have access the same file at the same time.
 * 
 * Mutex is the Semaphore with an access count of 1.
